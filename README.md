# Analyze A/B Test Results

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test to determine which version of a website is more effective. The A/B test was conducted by comparing two versions of the website's homepage. The first version of the homepage had a call to action button that was located in the top right corner of the page. The second version of the homepage had a call to action button that was located in the middle of the page.

The results of the A/B test showed that the second version of the homepage, with the call to action button in the middle of the page, had a higher conversion rate than the first version of the homepage. This suggests that the second version of the homepage is more effective at converting visitors into customers.

The following steps were taken to analyze the results of the A/B test:

1. The data from the A/B test was collected and imported into a spreadsheet.
2. The data was cleaned and organized.
3. The data was analyzed using statistical methods.
4. The results of the analysis were interpreted.

The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis of the A/B test results:

* The second version of the homepage, with the call to action button in the middle of the page, had a higher conversion rate than the first version of the homepage.
* The difference in conversion rates between the two versions of the homepage was statistically significant.
* The second version of the homepage is more effective at converting visitors into customers.

The following recommendations are made based on the results of the A/B test:

* The second version of the homepage should be used as the default homepage.
* Further research should be conducted to determine the optimal location for the call to action button on the homepage.
